    "text": "Date: Mon, 2 Apr 90 10:38:46 EDT\nFrom: Paul Hudak <hudak-paul>\nSubject: Release of Haskell Report\n\n\n                          Announcing\n\n                      The Haskell Report\n                         Version  1.0\n                         1 April 1990\n\nThe Haskell Committee, formed in September 1987 to design a \"common\"\nnon-strict purely functional language, has (finally) completed its work\nand wishes to announce a Report about the language.  Several preliminary\nversions of the Report were released to get feedback, and many changes\nhave been incorporated since the first release in December '88.  The\ncurrent release will remain STABLE for at least one year.\n\nYou may get the report via anonymous FTP:\nfrom Yale:                      from Glasgow:\n  ftp nebula.cs.yale.edu          ftp cs.glasgow.ac.uk\n  (or ftp 128.36.13.1)            \n  login: anonymous                login: guest\n  password: anonymous             password: <your username>\n  type binary                     type binary\n  cd pub/haskell-report           cd <FP>haskell-report\n  get report-1.0.tar.Z            get report-1.0.tar.Z\n  get report-1.0.dvi.Z            get report-1.0.dvi.Z\n  get report-1.0.ps.Z             get report-1.0.ps.Z\n  quit                            quit\n\nThe .tar file contains the source document in Unix tape archive\nformat; alternatively the .dvi or .ps files may be used for printing\nonly.  All of the files are in compress format; to uncompress them\ntype \"uncompress <filename>\" at the Unix shell.  The report is over\n100 pages long and has been formatted for double-sided copying.\n\nAlternatively, you may get a hard copy by:\n\nSending $10 to:                  Sending 5 pounds to:\nThe Haskell Project              The Haskell Project            \nDepartment of Computer Science   Department of Computing Science\nYale University                  University of Glasgow          \nBox 2158 Yale Station            Glasgow  G12 8QQ                \nNew Haven, CT 06520 USA          SCOTLAND                        \n\nTwo implementations of Haskell will soon be available, one built at the\nUniversity of Glasgow, the other at Yale University.
